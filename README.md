## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Senior Site Reliability Engineer** specializing in operating and scaling revenue-critical fintech platforms under strict availability, security, and compliance requirements.

My work focuses on designing resilient cloud architectures, improving production reliability, and enabling engineering teams to safely deliver software at scale. I operate mission-critical systems running in **Google Cloud Platform** and **Kubernetes** environments, applying Infrastructure as Code, observability, and incident management practices to continuously improve system stability and performance.

Currently acting as a **Tech Lead**, I drive reliability initiatives including PCI DSS compliance, incident response processes, postmortems, and platform scalability strategies supporting high-traffic payment and affiliate ecosystems.

My background combines software engineering, networking, and cloud infrastructure, allowing me to bridge development and operations while aligning technical decisions with business outcomes.
